Everything is fixed and updated. I've created a pull request. And I also have some ideas about page design. @Arthur could you provide me with logos, images, etc. for a website? Or I can choose images myself? Thanks.

ok, cool. how much blocks you want to create for this homepage? There's few headers and one footer, so we need to think about page structure between these elements. I propose to make something like that:
- header
- about us
- our services
- blog (?)
- something else
- footer
I'll try to implement this structure this weekend and I'll fix merge conflicts when I get home

I was thinking about from 5-7 sections. and i like your layout.
---
for blog section we can use a links from our Medium "blog"
---
for team we actually building a separate website - so we'll have a lot of data prepared for you
---
maybe we'll replace "our services" with an explanation of our sub-project aka features. but logic is the same - to showcase what we have or will have
